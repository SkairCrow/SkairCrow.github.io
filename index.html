  <h1>Welcome to New Weird America</h1>
  <p><strong>A Platform for the Builders of the Next World</strong></p>
  <p>We’re not here to patch the system. We’re here to replace it — from the dirt up, with real tools for real people building resilient communities.</p>
  <p><em>New Weird America</em> is the beta launch of the <strong>Decentralized Community Network (DCN)</strong> — an open-source platform for homesteaders, off-gridders, rebels, and revivalists who are done waiting for permission. It’s part of our <strong>Community Co-op Initiative</strong>, and it’s for those who believe that freedom starts with local control, shared knowledge, and mutual support.</p>
  <p>This is infrastructure for the weirdos, the builders, the dreamers, and the doers. And it’s just getting started.</p>

  <h2>What’s Inside the Toolkit</h2>
  <p>We’re not trying to recreate Facebook. We’re building something useful. These tools are modular, federated, and designed to grow with your community.</p>

  <h3>🏡 Communities</h3>
  <p>Start or join a node — physical or digital. Define roles, supported trades, bylaws, and connect with other nodes by region, purpose, or vibe. From a Discord server to a 40-acre farm, you belong here.</p>

  <h3>🗺️ Map</h3>
  <p>Visualize the growing web of nodes, routes, travelers, events, and community zones — defined not by borders, but by values. Filter, zoom, and explore the living network.</p>

  <h3>📚 Courses</h3>
  <p>Publish or join hands-on lessons: from seed saving to server setup. Learn collaboratively with Learning Circles, fork and remix content, and use it offline.</p>

  <h3>💬 Forum</h3>
  <p>Structured threads with lifecycle states: open, resolved, archived. Collaborate on problems, propose solutions, and log experiments. Less scrolling, more solving.</p>

  <h3>📅 Events</h3>
  <p>Find and host workshops, festivals, cleanups, and actions. Integrated with maps and calendars, this helps bring the digital into the dirt.</p>

  <h3>♻️ Exchange</h3>
  <p>Trade goods, services, and surplus. Local or remote. Cash or barter. Tag your goods by method (wildcrafted, solar-forged, etc.) and build a profile you control.</p>

  <h3>🧠 Library / Knowledge Base</h3>
  <p>Community-curated permaculture notes, bylaws, land use patterns, DIYs, tool manuals, and blueprints. Git-backed and markdown-friendly.</p>

  <h3>👤 Profiles & Badging</h3>
  <p>Show your trades, skills, and projects. Earn recognition by participation. Build reputation without hierarchy.</p>

  <h3>🛰️ Messenger / Signals</h3>
  <p>Low-bandwidth peer-to-peer communications. Matrix and Nostr compatible. Use basic mode when offline, traveling, or deep in the woods.</p>

  <h2>This is a Beta. You Are the Testers.</h2>
  <p>We’ve built the bones — now we need the people who know what these tools are for. Come help us build a platform that serves, supports, and grows with real community.</p>
