    <h1>New Weird America</h1>
    <p><strong>A Platform for the Builders of the Next World</strong></p>
    <p>We’re not here to patch the system. We’re here to replace it — from the dirt up, with real tools for real people building resilient communities.</p>
    <p><em>New Weird America</em> is the beta launch of the <strong>Decentralized Community Network (DCN)</strong> — an open-source platform for homesteaders, off-gridders, rebels, and revivalists who are done waiting for permission.</p>

    <h2>What’s Inside the Toolkit</h2>

    <section class="module">
      <h3>🏡 Communities</h3>
      <p>Create or join a node — whether a cabin in the woods or a digital guild. Establish your place in the network, define your trade or mission, write your bylaws, and connect with others through a federation of like-minded hubs.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="module">
      <h3>🗺️ Map</h3>
      <p>An interactive and evolving atlas of active communities, trade routes, local currencies, and bioregional zones. Discover real-world and digital activity clusters shaped by values, not governments. Watch the movement unfold geographically and socially.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="module">
      <h3>📚 Courses</h3>
      <p>Participate in peer-led, decentralized education — from ancient skills to digital infrastructure. Launch or join modular courses, remix lessons, and collaborate through Learning Circles designed to empower and proliferate community knowledge.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="module">
      <h3>💬 Forum</h3>
      <p>A living commons for research, storytelling, coordination, and knowledge exchange. Threads evolve over time, archive into the Knowledge Base, and serve as a space for proposals, experiments, and dialogue across nodes.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="module">
      <h3>📅 Events</h3>
      <p>Host or attend seasonal festivals, barn raisings, work parties, skill shares, and regional meetups. Events sync to the map, support offline modes, and are designed for asynchronous planning across time zones and connectivity levels.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="module">
      <h3>♻️ Exchange</h3>
      <p>A decentralized trade network that supports barter, gifting, and mutual credit. Browse goods and services by method of production, ethical tags, bioregion, or exchange preferences. Build local economies that value transparency and reciprocity.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="module">
      <h3>🧠 Library / Knowledge Base</h3>
      <p>A living, versioned archive of community-generated content — including blueprints, bylaws, technical documentation, zines, and oral histories. All entries are citation-ready, forkable, and built for long-term preservation and interoperability.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="module">
      <h3>👤 Profiles & Badging</h3>
      <p>Every member gets a dynamic profile that tracks contributions, skills, trades, and participation. Earn badges for work, mentorship, governance, and stewardship. Use profiles to find collaborators or showcase your journey across the network.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="module">
      <h3>🛰️ Messenger / Signals</h3>
      <p>Resilient messaging tools for synchronous and asynchronous communication. Supports Matrix and Nostr protocols, with fallback to low-bandwidth peer-to-peer signals. Designed for autonomy, redundancy, and life beyond the grid.</p>
    </section>
